**`PORT`**

The default port the query engine runs on is port `8000`. You can change this using the `PORT` environment variable.

**`VIZZLY_QUERY_ENGINE_HOST`**

The protocol and host domain of the query engine. This excludes the base path which can be configured using the `VIZZLY_BASE_PATH` variable.
For example `https://query.example.co` would be a valid query engine host value.

This environment variable is required.

**`VIZZLY_BASE_PATH`**

This changes the base path of the Vizzly query engine. For example you might have a routing layer that matches requests for `/vizzly-query-engine/*`, and forwards them too the
query engine. In which case, you'd set this value too `/vizzly-query-engine` so the requests match the path matchers in the query engine.

This environment variable is not required, and defaults too `''`.

**`VIZZLY_CONFIG_FILE`**

Changes the path at which the config file resides inside the running container.

This environment variable is not required, and defaults to `/etc/vizzly/vizzly.config.json`.
