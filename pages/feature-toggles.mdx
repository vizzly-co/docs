# Feature toggles

Vizzly "feature toggles" allow you to control the user's experience of the dashboard.
This enables you to tailer the Vizzly experience to your users. For example using feature toggles
you could provide a completely static dashboard, or one without the component library and only allow users to create
"standalone" components directly on the dashboard.

### Usage

Feature toggles are provided through the `featureToggles` property in the React component. Below is a list of 
values which you have control over.

```tsx
<Vizzly.Dashboard
  featureToggles={{
    showGlobalFilters: boolean;
    canEditComponentLibrary: boolean;
    canUseCalculatedFields: boolean;
    canUseComponentLibrary: boolean;
    canCreateStandaloneComponents: boolean;
    canDownloadComponentData: boolean;
    canEditComponentsOnDashboard: boolean;
    canRemoveComponentsFromDashboard: boolean;
    canConfigureLocalFilters: boolean;
  }}

  // ... other props - see https://docs.vizzly.co/react-component
