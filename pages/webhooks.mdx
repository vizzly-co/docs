# Webhooks

A webhook is a message that Vizzly will send your servers, when something happens.

Webhooks are a powerful developer feature for reacting to certain events that occur on your
user's dashboards in real-time, or handling scheduled events.

#### Supported events
- [Scheduled reports](./webhooks/scheduled-reports)

### Acknowledging events

When you successfully handle a webhook, it is important to respond with a `200` status code.
Otherwise, Vizzly will keep retrying until a `200` is received.

We also guarantee at least 1 delivery attempt, even if your server does respond with a `200` status
code, so you should design your system to be idempotent. This means being able to handle the exact same
event multiple times, but keeping your system in the correct state.

#### Retries
When your webhook endpoint does not respond with a `200` status code, we will retry
with the following behaviour;

- We will back-off our attempts exponentially with a minimum of a 15 second gap between each attempt.
- Upon each attempt, we will add a small amount of jitter so failed requests aren't sent in waves.
- We will retry until approximately 12 days later, or the equivalent of the 20th attempt.
