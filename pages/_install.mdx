To add Vizzly to your React app, you'll need to install our node package, which can be added by running the following command:

<Tabs items={["yarn", "npm"]}>
    <Tab>

    ```shell
    yarn add @vizzly/dashboard
    ```

    </Tab>
    <Tab>

    ```shell
    npm install @vizzly/dashboard
    ```

    </Tab>

</Tabs>
