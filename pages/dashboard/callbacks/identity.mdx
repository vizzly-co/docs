# Identity

The purpose of the identity callback is to generate two JSON web tokens (JWTs) that provide access to the dashboard configuration, and access to the user's data.
These keys are signed with your private key on your server, and validated with the public key you upload to Vizzly, and provide in the Vizzly config of the Vizzly Query Engine.

## Server side token generation

Install the auth package;

```shell
yarn add @vizzly/auth
```

Import the auth package;

```ts
import * as VizzlyAuth from "@vizzly/auth";
```

Then to use the auth package, here's an example;

  <RemoteCodeBlock name="identity" />
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
  Install the Vizzly package;

```shell
pip3 install git+https://github.com/vizzly-co/python.git#egg=vizzly
```

Use the Vizzly library;

```python
import vizzly

private_key = """
-----BEGIN EC PRIVATE KEY-----

**What is access type?**

The accessType value can either be `editor` or `standard` and controls who gets to modify the initial dashboard new users will see.

Set this value to `editor` if the current user should be allowed to manage the dashboard that every user will initially see. Most commonly, this value will be set to `editor` only for certain staff from your company.

If you're an `editor` - you'll see a banner at the top of the dashboard with a "configure" button which will allow you to make changes to the default dashboard.
If you are a `standard` user, then you will not be able to see the banner.

The editor banner looks like this;

<img src="/img/editor-banner.png" style={{ width: "100%" }} />

#### Generating test identity configs

A test identity config can be generated using our CLI tool. To do this you will need to collect your organisation ID and template dashboard ID
from [the live dashboards page](https://app.vizzly.co/dashboards) on the Vizzly website after signing in.

<img src="/img/live-dashboards-screenshot.png" />

You will then be able to run the command which **MUST** only be used in development environments;

```shell
vizzly access-tokens \
  -o org_<<rest of organisation ID>> \
  -d dsh_<<rest of dashboard ID>> \
  -u "user 123456" \
  -t editor \
  --private-key vizzly-private.pem
```

That will generate an identity signature that you can use for testing. This **MUST** only be used in test environments, as it grants full read access to all the data
in the database.

<details>
  <summary>Example test identity config</summary>

```json
{
  "dashboardAccessToken": "...",
  "dataAccessToken": "..."
}
```

</details>

### Finding parameters

To find your `organisationId` and `initialDashboard` values of your live dashboards, see the [parameters](/parameters) doc.

### Controlling data set access

If you're running the Vizzly query engine, the `dataSetIds` value of the data access token is where you can control what data sets your
users have access too. For example, say you have 3 data sets defined in the configuration file of your Vizzly query engine, which have IDs
`das_1`, `das_2` and `das_3`, then you could return an identity config which only specifies `das_1` and `das_2` in the `dataSets` parameter, and
prevent the user from having access to the third data set.

### Multi-tenancy with secure filters

To secure access to your data sets, you must provide a list of secure filters for each data set that is available to the user. For example, say you have
a data set with an ID of `das_1`, and you want to only show users there own data from this data set, you might specify a `secureFilters` value of:

```ts
{
  secureFilters: {
    "das_1": [{
      field: "User ID",
      op: "=",
      value: 1
    }]
  }
  // ... rest of identity config
}
```

These secure filters will be signed and sent to the Vizzly query engine by the Vizzly react embed, where they will be validated using your organisation's public key and ensure that each user only ever has access to their own data.

#### Reduce the impact of a compromised private key

If your private key becomes compromised, then one way to reduce the impact of this is to also [provide secure filters on your data sets defined in the config of your Vizzly query engine.](/query-engines/self-hosted-query-engine#optional-secure-filter-guards)

### Generating private and public keys

For help generating the public and private keys, please see the [security docs](/security).

## Client side

The client side implementation of the identity callback can be as simple as the following;

<RemoteCodeBlock name="appjs" />
