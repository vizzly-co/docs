# Custom theme

Vizzly ships with a default theme to get you started quickly. However, when the time comes to customize the
style of the dashboard, we make this easy for you by exposing CSS classes on the HTML elements, and making certain components replaceable.

## Components

Currently, the Vizzly dashboard exposes one component that can be replaced, which is the loading component.
You can provide a custom loading component using the `renderLoadingComponent` React prop.

```jsx
import Vizzly from '@vizzly/dashboard';

const CustomLoadingComponent = () => <p>Loading...</p>

<Vizzly.Dashboard
  renderLoadingComponent={CustomLoadingComponent}

  // Rest of the dashboard props ...
/>
```

It's in our roadmap to make many more components replaceable.

## Icons

To replace the icons, you can provide render callbacks to the `Vizzly.Dashboard` through React props.

```jsx
import Vizzly from '@vizzly/dashboard';

const CustomComponent = () => <p>Your react component</p>

<Vizzly.Dashboard
  renderUndoIcon={CustomComponent}
  renderCompletedIcon={CustomComponent}
  renderInProgressIcon={CustomComponent}
  renderDeleteIcon={CustomComponent}
  renderPlusIcon={CustomComponent}
  renderCloseIcon={CustomComponent}
  renderFilterIcon={CustomComponent}
  renderEditIcon={CustomComponent}
  renderComponentOptionsMenuIcon={CustomComponent}
  renderMergeCellIcon={CustomComponent}
  renderSplitCellIcon={CustomComponent}
  renderDownloadIcon={CustomComponent}
  renderInsertRowBelowIcon={CustomComponent}
  renderInsertRowAboveIcon={CustomComponent}
  renderAppendCellIcon={CustomComponent}
  renderLibraryIcon={CustomComponent}
  renderCreateComponentIcon={CustomComponent}
  renderAccordionIcon={CustomComponent}

  // Rest of the dashboard props ...
/>
```

To make improve the discoverability of replaceable icons, when you're in editor mode, you'll
be able to highlight the icons which can be replaced, by toggling the 'Highlight replaceable components' button in the
top menu of the editor.

<img
  style={{ marginTop: "10px" }}
  src="/img/toggle-replaceable-components.png"
/>

This will then highlight the icons which can be replaced with a red border.

<img style={{ marginTop: "10px" }} src="/img/highlight-replaceable-icon.png" />

You can then hold the "Shift" key on your keyboard, and click within the red outlined component to
open the developer instructions in a modal.

<img
  style={{ marginTop: "10px" }}
  src="/img/example-description-to-replace-component.png"
/>

## CSS

To make the dashboard look and feel like the rest of your website, we've added CSS class names which allow you complete control over the customization of your dashboard.

You can write a CSS file that uses the `vizzly_` prefixed CSS class names to override the Vizzly base styles.

Before you start writing your CSS, remember to add the `disableVizzlyTheme` React prop to the `Dashboard` component and then start making your CSS changes. You'll see a more un-opinionated version of
the Vizzly dashboard, and it will be easier to add your own theme and maintain in the future.

For example, if you're using a library such as [`react-helmet`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-helmet) that supplies the `Head` component in this example,
then your diff might look something like this;

```diff
import Vizzly from "@vizzly/dashboard";


export default () => (
  <>
+    <Head>
+      <style>
+       .vizzly_button {
+           background: green;
+       }
+      </style>
+    </Head>

    <Vizzly.Dashboard
+      disableVizzlyTheme
      {/* ... rest of the dashboard props ... */ }
      />
  </>
)
```

### Available CSS classes

This is an exhaustive list of CSS classes which can be used to customize the Vizzly dashboard. We recommend combining this list
with [searching through the elements using the inspector developer tool](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/dom/) to target
the components which you want to customize.

If there is a part of the Vizzly dashboard that you'd like to make customizable, please contact us through your
shared slack channel with us, and we'll see what we can do to help.

### Importing the CSS

As you customize the Vizzly dashboard using CSS classes, you can import these styles in the idiomatic ways;

- You can set the styles in the `head` tag of the HTML document.
- As a separate CSS file referenced in the `head` tag of the HTML document.
- Using a CSS in JS approach such as [styled-components](https://styled-components.com) to create global styles.

### Troubleshooting

<details>
  <summary>"My custom styles are having no effect"</summary>

There's a few simple things that might be causing the issue;

1. Be sure that you have set the `disableVizzlyTheme={true}` property on the `Vizzly.Dashboard` React component.
2. Be sure that you are targeting an HTML element [with valid CSS](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/).
3. Be sure that the CSS selector is finding the element on the page. You can use the chrome developer tools in the "style" section to do this. You'll see the styles you want to be applied are crossed out.

After checking the above and the problem continues, then it is time to increase the specificity of the CSS references.
You can do this by targeting the HTML element multiple times with the same selector. For example, instead of just specifying the selector like so;

```css
button.vizzly_primary {
  background: red;
}
```

you can utilize the `v` class which will also exist on the HTML element which has `vizzly_` classnames on, and reference the element like so;

```css
.v.button.vizzly_primary {
  background: red;
}
```

If it is still being overridden, you can keep adding the `v` class until your styles take effect. For example;

```css
.v.v.v.v.button.vizzly_primary {
  background: red;
}
```
