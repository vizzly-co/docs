# Scheduled reports 

Scheduled reports are available for the "basic table" component, and allows 
your users to setup a report on any given cadence.

Vizzly manages the time-keeping of such reports, and sends a webhook
containing the query to generate results for the report, at the time the user wants it.

Once you have [set up the webhook](./get-started), you can add the property
`reportScheduleOptions` to the Vizzly Dashboard component, and set the frequency values
that you want to be made available to your users to choose from. For example,
you might set;

```jsx
<Vizzly.Dashboard
  // ... the other props
  reportScheduleOptions={[
    {cron: '* * * * *', description: 'Every minute'},
    {cron: '0 * * * *', description: 'Every hour'}
  ]}
/>
```

which would allow your users to pick from an "every minute", or an "every hour" schedule.
