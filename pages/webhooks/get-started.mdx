# Get started with webhooks

To manage your webhooks, visit [the webhooks page](https://app.vizzly.co/webhooks), and click the button to create your first webhook.

You'll be asked to enter a name and HTTPS endpoint of the webhook you want to create. The endpoint is where Vizzly will send a
`POST` request with the event payload which will be different for each webhook event type.

Once have created your first webhook, you'll then link it to [your dashboard templates](https://app.vizzly.co/dashboards), by
using the select input field under the "webhook" column on that page.

#### Reading and verifying webhook events

To be certain that a webhook has originated from Vizzly servers, the POST request body will be a [Json Web Token (JWT)](https://jwt.io)
signed with a private key owned by Vizzly.

To securely access the information sent in the webhook event, you should verify the request body using the Vizzly webhook
public key. You can do this using [our NPM auth package `@vizzly/auth`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@vizzly/auth).

The content of each webhook message will vary depending on the type of webhook we send to you. Every webhook
will contain a `type` value, which you can use to understand what the event is that we've sent.
