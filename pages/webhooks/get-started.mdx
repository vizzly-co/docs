# Get started with webhooks

To manage your webhooks, visit [the webhooks page](https://app.vizzly.co/webhooks), and click the button to create your first webhook.

You'll be asked to enter a name and HTTPS endpoint of the webhook you want to create. The endpoint is where Vizzly will send a
`POST` request with the event payload which will be different for each webhook event type.

#### Reading and verifying webhook events

To be certain that a webhook has originated from Vizzly servers, the POST request body will be a [Json Web Token (JWT)](https://jwt.io)
signed with a private key owned by Vizzly.

To securely access the information sent in the webhook event, you should verify the request body using the Vizzly webhook
public key. You can do this using [our NPM auth package `@vizzly/auth`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@vizzly/auth).
