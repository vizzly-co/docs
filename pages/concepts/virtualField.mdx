# Virtual field

Virtual fields are a way of building fields in your data set from the fields which already exist.

You can use mathematical operators and conditions to define these fields.

<Tabs items={["Type definition", "Example"]}>
  <Tab>

```typescript
type VirtualField = {
  // https://docs.vizzly.co/concepts/field
  field: Field;

  // Describes how the value of the field is calculated.
  definition: Definition;
};
```

  </Tab>
  <Tab>

  </Tab>
</Tabs>
