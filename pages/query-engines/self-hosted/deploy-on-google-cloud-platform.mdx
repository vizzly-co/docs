# Deploy Vizzly on Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

GCP offers multiple products to run containers in the cloud, which are all supported by Vizzly. Some examples include;

- [GCP Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run).
- [GCP Kubernetes Engine](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine).

We recommend using Google's Cloud Run product to get setup quickly, but be sure to set the number of minimum
instances to at least `1`, to avoid the "cold start time".

### GCP Query Engine URI

```
eu.gcr.io/vizzly/query-engine

### Installing the Vizzly config

When running on Google's Cloud Run product, adding the config and GCP service account credentials to the docker image is simple using the Google Secret Manager.
You can then mount these files to the docker container when going through the setup wizard as shown in the screenshots below.
