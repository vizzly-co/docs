# Create results

The `/api/v1/create-results` endpoint on the self hosted query engine, accepts
`POST` HTTP requests containing Vizzly formatted queries, and returns results in the Vizzly format.

## When would I use this?

If you have Vizzly webhooks set up, you will start receiving real-time and scheduled events to your endpoint. One such example is
a scheduled report event, which contains all the information needed to run a query against the
query engine. Then, you can package the result in any format you like such as a CSV or a PDF and send this to your users.

## Implementation details

The request body should match the following type definition;

```typescript
{
  queries: Array<Query>;
  virtualFields: {
    [dataSetId: string]: Array<VirtualField>;
  };
  identityConfigIntegritySignature: string;
}
```

#### Identity config integrity signature

This is a data access token, that is one of the tokens returned by your [identity callback](/dashboard/callbacks/identity).

#### Query

<QueryFormat />

#### Virtual Fields

The structure of virtual fields is complex and in a state of flux. Therefore we will send the exact value to be used here in webhook events,
which you can pass through un-touched to the query engine.

### Response

The response, if successful, will contain a list of results, which you can use to build CSVs, PDFs, `.xlsx` files, or send [to
Google Sheets using their API](https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/guides/concepts).
