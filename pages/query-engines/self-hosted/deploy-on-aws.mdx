# Deploy Vizzly on Amazon Web Services (AWS)

AWS offers multiple products to run containers in the cloud, which are all supported by Vizzly. Some examples include;

- [AWS App Runner](https://aws.amazon.com/apprunner/)
- [AWS Fargate](https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/)
- [AWS Elastic Container Service](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/)

### AWS Query Engine URI
```
public.ecr.aws/w4r1h9k0/vizzly-query-engine
```

### Installing the Vizzly config
Upon startup, the Vizzly query engine can be configured to install the config from various sources.

<InstallConfigFromGitHub />

You can also download the Vizzly config file from S3 by setting both `VIZZLY_CONFIG_S3_BUCKET_NAME` and `VIZZLY_CONFIG_S3_BUCKET_REGION` environment
variables at runtime, and ensure the docker image runs with the necessary permissions required to download objects from the S3 bucket with the config file in.

For example, `VIZZLY_CONFIG_S3_BUCKET_NAME=my-app-vizzly-config` and `VIZZLY_CONFIG_S3_BUCKET_REGION=us-east-1`.

This will download all the files in the bucket `my-app-vizzly-config` in the region `us-east-1` to `/etc/vizzly`.
Therefore, naming the config file `vizzly.config.json` will download the config to the correct place by default.
