# Self-hosted

Run a docker image in your cloud to run queries against your database and power the dashboards your users see.

The fastest way to get started with the self-hosted docker image, is to use our Vizzly CLI, which you can install by running the following command;

```shell
npm i @vizzly/cli -g
```

To see all available commands, run `vizzly -h`.

#### Creating a key-pair

To create a private and public certificate key-pair to use with Vizzly, you can run the following command

```shell
vizzly create-key-pair
```

#### Creating a Vizzly config template

After creating your key-pair, you can run the following command to create a template of the Vizzly config:

```shell
vizzly init -i <<integration>>
```

Remember, you can run `vizzly init --help` to see how to use this command, and see a list of all available integrations.

### Config file

The query engine requires some configuration to allow it to connect to your database, and to define virtual tables which are exposed to your users from which they can build their own dashboards.

In [our examples repo](https://github.com/vizzly-co/library-examples), we have Vizzly config examples [for each of our integrations](https://github.com/vizzly-co/library-examples/tree/main/config-examples).

We're using our CLI tool to validate these example configs, which [you can read more about here](/vizzly-config-ci) should you wish to add this to your setup too.

#### File location

The Vizzly config file will need to be mounted into the Vizzly docker image, in the default location of `/etc/vizzly/vizzly.config.json`.

If you wish to customize the location of your Vizzly config file, you can do so using the `VIZZLY_CONFIG_FILE` runtime environment variable.

#### Connection credentials

The Vizzly docker image will need read-only access to your database. These credentials are specified in the Vizzly config file, and therefore the entire config file should be treated as a secret.

The typescript definition of the credentials is as follows:

<Tabs items={["Postgres", "BigQuery", "ElasticSearch"]}>
<Tab>

```ts
{
  client: "postgres";
  connection: {
    password: string;
    database: string;
    user: string;
    host: string;
    port: number;
  }
}
```

</Tab>
<Tab>

```ts
{
  client: "bigquery";
  connection: {
    projectId: string;
    location: string;
    keyFilename: string;
  }
}
```

</Tab>

<Tab>

```ts
{
  client: "elasticsearch";
  cloud?: {
    id: string;
  },
  auth:
    | { username: string; password: string; }
    | { apiKey: string; }
    | { id: string; api_key: string; }
    | { bearer: string; }
}
```

#### Data sets

You'll need to define the available data sets for your users. You'll be able to define which data sets the user has access to in the [identity callback](/callbacks/identity).

The typescript definition of a data set is as follows:

<Tabs items={["Postgres", "BigQuery", "ElasticSearch"]}>
<Tab>

```ts
{
  /*
    ID of the data set that remains constant.
  */
  id: string;

  /*
    A public name that describes this data set to your users.
  */
  name: string;

  /*
    Fields that define the flat schema of the data set.
  */
  fields: {
    /*
      A unique reference to this field, and should remain constant.
    */
    id: string;

    /*
      The name of the field. For example, this would be the column
      name if you're running a postgres database.
    */
    name: string;

    /*
      What type of data does this field contain?
    */
    dataType: 'number' | 'boolean' | 'string' | 'date_time';

    /*
      The name of this field that your users will see.
    */
    publicName: string;

    /*
      The name of the table in the database
    */
    table: string;
  }[];

  joins: {
      type:
        | "rightJoin"
        | "leftJoin"
        | "innerJoin"
        | "outerJoin"
        | "leftOuterJoin"
        | "rightOuterJoin";
      left: {
        field: string;
        table: string;
      };
      right: {
        field: string;
        table: string;
      };
    }[];
}
```

</Tab>
<Tab>

```ts
{
  /*
    ID of the data set that remains constant.
  */
  id: string;

  /*

    */
    dataType: 'number' | 'boolean' | 'string' | 'date_time';

    /*
      The name of this field that your users will see.
    */
    publicName: string;

    /*
      The name of the table in the database
    */
    table: string;
  }[];

  joins: {

    /*

    */
    table: string;
  }
  [];
}
```

#### Joins

If you're using an integration with a SQL database, then in the Vizzly config file, it is possible to join fields that reside across multiple tables.

  <summary>Expand to see an example of how you would join two tables on a foreign key `city_id`.</summary>

```json
{
  "connection": {
    // ...
  },
  "dataSets": [
    {
      "id": "weather-by-city",
      "name": "Weather by city",
      "fields": [
        {
          "id": "field_1",
          "publicName": "City ID",
          "name": "id",
          "table": "cities",
          "dataType": "number"
        },
        {
          "id": "field_2",
          "publicName": "City",
          "name": "name",
          "table": "cities",
          "dataType": "number"
        },
        {
          "id": "field_3",
          "publicName": "Weather record ID",
          "name": "id",
          "table": "weather",
          "dataType": "number"
        },
        {
          "id": "field_4",
          "publicName": "City ID",
          "name": "city_id",
          "table": "weather",
          "dataType": "number"
        },
        {
          "id": "field_5",
          "publicName": "High temperature",
          "name": "high_temperature",
          "table": "weather",
          "dataType": "number"
        }
      ],
      "joins": [
        {
          "type": "leftJoin",
          "left": {
            "field": "id",
            "table": "cities"
          },
          "right": {
            "field": "city_id",
            "table": "weather"
          }
        }
      ],
      "secureFilterGuards": []
    }
    // ...
  ],
  "publicKeyCertificates": [
    // ...
  ]
}
```

</details>

#### Optional secure filter guards

Secure filters are used to provide Vizzly's multi-tenancy feature, and they are defined in the [identity config](/callbacks/identity). However if you want to reduce the impact of your private key being compromised, you can also
define "secure filter guards" for each of the data sets. The purpose of a filter guard to limit the amount of data an attacker has
access too if they manage to steal your private key used for Vizzly.

The typescript definition of a secure filter guard is as follows:

```ts
type Operator =
  | ">"
  | "<"
  | "="
  | ">="
  | "<="
  | "is_one_of"
  | "is_not_one_of"
  | "starts_with"
  | "ends_with"
  | "contains_substring"
  | "does_not_contain_substring";

{
  fieldId: string; // The `id` of the field
  op: Operator;
}
```

### Cloud deployment

<Tabs items={["Amazon Web Services (AWS)", "Google Gloud Platform (GCP)"]}>
<Tab>
The [latest version of the Vizzly query engine can be found here](https://github.com/vizzly-co/ts/pkgs/container/query-engine).

The Vizzly query engine runs on AWS by downloading the `vizzly.config.json` file securely from an AWS S3 bucket upon startup. For this to work, you will specify the
`VIZZLY_CONFIG_S3_BUCKET_NAME` and `VIZZLY_CONFIG_S3_BUCKET_REGION` environment variables at runtime, and ensure the docker image runs with the necessary permissions
required to download objects from the S3 bucket with the config file in.

For example, `VIZZLY_CONFIG_S3_BUCKET_NAME=secure-vizzly-config` and `VIZZLY_CONFIG_S3_BUCKET_REGION=eu-west-2`.

This will download all the files in the bucket `secure-vizzly-config` in the region `VIZZLY_CONFIG_S3_BUCKET_REGION`, and save them to `/etc/vizzly`, so
naming the config file `vizzly.config.json` will download the config to the correct place by default.

Please contact us if you'd like read-only access to our AWS example account to see a working example!

</Tab>
<Tab>

To run the Vizzly query engine on GCP, we recommend using [Google's Cloud Run product](https://cloud.google.com/run).

The Vizzly container image URL is `eu.gcr.io/vizzly/query-engine`, and it runs on port `8000`. You'll also need to set the number of minimum instances to at least `1`
to avoid the "cold start time".

To add the config and GCP service account credentials to the docker image, we suggest uploading these files to the Google Secret Manager. You can then mount these files
to the docker container whilst provisioning the Google Cloud Run service to run Vizzly, as shown in the screenshots below;

### Limitations

#### Large numbers

Currently, the self-hosted docker image supports a precision of up to `9007199254740991`. The accuracy of operations performed on numbers greater than this number may be incorrect.
