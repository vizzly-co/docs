# Query

The Vizzly frontend builds queries which are sent to your custom query engine through the
`runQueriesCallback` async function passed into the Vizzly Dashboard react component.

The async `runQueriesCallback` function accepts a list of queries to be executed, and
should be returned as an array of results where the index of each result in the array corresponds
to the query at the same index in the array of queries.

### Format

<QueryFormat />

### Client side caching

By default, Vizzly checks a local cache to ensure duplicate queries aren't sent to your servers
in quick succession.
