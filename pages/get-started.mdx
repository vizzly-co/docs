# Get started

The fastest way to get setup with Vizzly, is to follow [our interactive guide](https://app.vizzly.co) after signing in to your account. 
It will guide you through setting up the Vizzly query engine, the identity logic and the React embed.

### The steps
Implementation can be broken down into 5 steps which typically takes 1.5 days of developer time in total.

1. Setup the Vizzly CLI.
2. Define the data sets for your users.
3. Deploy to your chosen cloud provider.
4. Code the identity logic with support from our SDKs.
5. Copy & paste the React component into your project!

#### Optional extras
Once you have the basics setup, then you can start enhancing the implementation by [customizing the dashboard](/theme) to fit 
into your application, and [making performance upgrades](/performance) to improve the overall experience!
