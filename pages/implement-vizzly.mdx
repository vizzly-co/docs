# Implementing Vizzly

In this document, we'll go through the recommended step-by-step procedure to add Vizzly to your application.


#### 1. Install the Vizzly CLI

`npm i @vizzly/cli -g`

#### 2. Generate the key-pair certificates

`vizzly create-key-pair`

Next, upload the public key you generated to your [organisation's public key pair store](https://app.vizzly.co/organisation/key-pairs).

Keep the private certificate very safe, as this will be used to authorize access to your database.

#### 3. Create the config file
Now we'll create the vizzly config.

`vizzly init-config -i <<integration>>`

Remember, you can run `vizzly init-config --help` to see how to use this command, and see a list of all available integrations.

#### 4. Define the data sets

The Vizzly config which you've created contains a `dataSets` key. This is where you'll specify the fields which are made available
to your users.

This will be different depending on which integration you are using, and therefore [we have documentation on setting up the config
file](/query-engines/self-hosted-query-engine#config-file).

Whilst you build your Vizzly config, you can validate it using the Vizzly CLI by running;

`vizzly validate -c ./vizzly.config.json`

#### 5. Implement the identity endpoint
This is an API endpoint on your servers, where you'll authenticate the user, and authorize their access to certain data sets
and provide the secure filters required for a multi-tenancy environment.

If your dashboard will be using publicly available data, then you can skip this step!

Be sure to set the `userType` to `'editor'` for your own company accounts. This will let you customize the initial
dashboard and theme once it is embedded into your application.

#### 6. Add the Vizzly React component
Add the [Vizzly component to your application](/react-component) and deploy!

#### 7. Managing the template dashboard
As a user, visit the Vizzly dashboard in your application, and so long as the identity endpoint sets `userType` to be an `'editor'` for your session, 
then you'll be able to configure the template dashboard that your users first see when using the Vizzly dashboard.
