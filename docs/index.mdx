# Docs

Vizzly offers embeddable dashboards your users can customize.

At its simplest, Vizzly provides a [React component](/react-component) which renders a fully customisable dashboarding experience.

The React component includes callbacks that enables numerous ways of fetching and querying data.

The dashboard component exists in the `@vizzly/dashboard` package.

<Install />

Then load the Vizzly components into your react files;

```ts
import Vizzly from "@vizzly/dashboard";
```

The dashboard component is available at `<Vizzly.Dashboard />`, and the props vary depending on how you wish to [implement the query engine](/category/query-engines), and we generally recommend the [self-hosted query engine](/query-engines/self-hosted-query-engine).

### Examples
We maintain a [public repository](https://github.com/vizzly-co/library-examples) with working examples of how to run Vizzly.
