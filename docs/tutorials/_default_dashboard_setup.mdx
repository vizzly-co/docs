## Build your default dashboard

### 1. Uploading your data resource
Vizzly needs a test sample of data that represents what the production data will look like.

1. [Download the sample data](./us-sales-tutorial-data-resource.csv)
2. Click on the "Get started" tile on the [app home page](https://app.vizzly.co)
3. Enter a name of "US Sales tutorial" for the data resource because for this tutorial we'll use US sales data.
4. Upload the sample data you downloaded in step 1 using the file input.
5. Click "Continue" when you're shown the preview of the sampele data.

You should now see the [Vizzly studio](https://app.vizzly.co/studio). We can now start building the default dashboard
that we want to initially show to your users.

### 2. Creating your first dashboard

1. Click the grid icon in one of the cells on the dashboard. This will bring up the component library
<img src="/img/empty-component-library.png" />
2. Click "create new"
3. Ensure the "US Sales tutorial" data resource is selected when you are shown previews of your available data resources.
4. Click on the "Bar chart", and you'll see Vizzly auto-populate some properties of the chart, and show you a preview of the bar chart.
5. Set the following data properties
<ul>
  <li>A measure with the field 'qty_ordered', and an aggregate function of 'mean'.</li>
  <li>A dimension set to the 'status' field.</li>
  <li>Time dimension set to the `order_date` field truncated monthly.</li>
</ul>
6. Click 'confirm' to add the chart to your dashboard.

Now you've added a component to your dashboard, and made it available in the component library. If you only want the component to be available
on the dashboard, then next time hit the "plus" icon in each of the cells instead.

### 3. Setting the theme

At the top right corner of the screen, you'll see multiple menu options.

1. Click the paint brush icon in the top right header menu.
2. Change the brand colours to match your style.
3. Toggle the "detailed" switch to see the impact it has on the bar chart.
4. Click off the theme modal to close it.
5. Click the cloud icon in the top right header menu to save and publish your dashboard.

### 4. Dashboard preview
To view your dashboard as your customer would, click on the "eye" icon in the top right header menu. You'll see the header
change slightly to better represent what your dashboard will look like in a non-Vizzly environment.

You'll now be able to interact with the dashboard exactly how your end-user might. You'll be able to add the bar chart you created
earlier in the component library, as well as create your own charts.

To go back to the studio, click on the preview icon again on the top right corner of the screen.
