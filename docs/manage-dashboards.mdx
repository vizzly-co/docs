# Managing dashboards

To create, delete and list your user's dashboards, you can use our `Vizzly.useDashboardManager` react hook.

All that is required, is the same [identity callback as used in the Dashboard component](/callbacks/identity). For example, your implementation might look like this;

```ts
import Vizzly from '@vizzly/dashboard';

const identityCallback = async () => {
  const response = await fetch("/api/identity?type=custom");
  if (response.ok) {
    const tokens = await response.json();

    return tokens;
  }

  return null;
};

const { dashboards, deleteEndUserDashboard, createNewEndUserDashboard } = Vizzly.useDashboardManager(identityCallback);
```

- `dashboards` is the list of dashboards the current user has.

- `deleteEndUserDashboard` is a function that will instantly remove the dashboard. You may want to first prompt the user if they
are sure they wish to delete the dashboard, before calling this function for a better user experience.

- `createNewEndUserDashboard` will create a new dashboard, based from the template `dashboardId` returned in the `dashboardAccessToken`
of the identity callback.


### Example usage
Here a complete example of how to use it, which displays a grid of dashboards, with the functionality to create more dashboards, or delete existing ones.
