# CI with Vizzly

It's easy to add a validation step to your CI process, that installs the Vizzly CLI
and runs the `vizzly validate` command. This ensures that your Vizzly configs stored in version control
are valid, and will work when deployed to your running Vizzly query engine.

If you're using GitHub, we have an officially supported GitHub action that makes this even easier. All you have to do is create a GitHub action file in your
project; `/.github/workflows/validate-configs.yml` and add the following configuration.

```yaml
on: [push]

jobs:
  validate_vizzly_configs:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: A job to validate Vizzly config examples
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v1
      - name: Validate Vizzly configs
        uses: vizzly-co/validate-config-action@main
        with:
          config-file-glob: './config-examples/*.config.json'
```

***NOTE*** In the example we set the `config-file-glob` argument to check for config files in the `config-examples` directory, but you will likely want to change this so your Vizzly config file is detected and validated.

We use this github action on [our own library examples repository](https://github.com/vizzly-co/library-examples), to ensure all our example configs are up-to-date.
