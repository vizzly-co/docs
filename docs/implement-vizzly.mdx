# Implementing Vizzly

In this document, we'll go through the recommended step-by-step procedure to add Vizzly to your application.


#### 1. Install the Vizzly CLI

`npm i @vizzly/cli -g`

#### 2. Generate the key-pair certificates

`vizzly create-key-pair`

#### 3. Upload the public key
Upload the public key to your [organisation's public key pair store](https://app.vizzly.co/organisation/key-pairs).

#### 4. Create the config file

`vizzly init`

#### 5. Complete the config file

This will be different depending on where your data is housed, and therefore [we have documentation on setting up the config
file](/query-engines/self-hosted-query-engine#config-file).

#### 6. Implement identity API endpoint
This is the API endpoint on your servers, where you'll authenticate the user, and authorize their access to certain data sets
and provide the secure filters required for a multi-tenancy environment.

If your dashboard will be using publicly available data, then you can skip this step!

Be sure to set the `userType` to `'editor'` for your own, and other admin accounts. This will let you customize the initial
dashboard and theme once it is embedded into your application.

#### 7. Add the Vizzly React component
Add the [Vizzly component to your application](/react-component) and deploy!

#### 8. Configuring the default dashboard
As a user, visit the Vizzly dashboard in your application, and if you've set your account to be an `'editor'` `userType` in the identity
callback, then you'll be able to configure the initial dashboard users see when first using the Vizzly dashboard, and its theme.
