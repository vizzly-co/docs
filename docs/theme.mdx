# Custom themes

Vizzly ships with a Vizzly theme which provides a sensible default theme to get you started quickly. However, when the time comes to customize the
style of the dashboard, we make this easy for you by exposing CSS classes on the HTML elements.

To make the dashboard look and feel like the rest of your website, we've added CSS class names which allow you complete control over the customization of your dashboard.

You can write a CSS file that uses the `vizzly_` prefixed CSS class names to override the Vizzly base styles.

Before you start writing your CSS, remember to add the `disableVizzlyTheme` React prop to the `Dashboard` component and then start making your CSS changes. You'll see a more un-opinionated version of
the Vizzly dashboard, and it will be easier to add your own theme and maintain in the future.

For example, if you're using a library such as [`react-helmet`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-helmet) that supplies the `Head` component in this example,
then your diff might look something like this;

````diff
import Vizzly from "@vizzly/dashboard";


export default () => (
  <>
+    <Head>
+      <style>
+       .vizzly_button {
+           background: green;
+       }
+      </style>
+    </Head>

    <Vizzly.Dashboard
+      disableVizzlyTheme
      {/* ... rest of the dashboard props ... */ }
      />
  </>
)
````

## Importing the CSS
As you customize the Vizzly dashboard using CSS classes, you can import these styles in the idiomatic ways;

- You can set the styles in the `head` tag of the HTML document.
- As a separate CSS file referenced in the `head` tag of the HTML document.
- Using a CSS in JS approach such as [styled-components](https://styled-components.com) to create global styles.

## Available CSS classes

This is an exhaustive list of CSS classes which can be used to customize the Vizzly dashboard. We recommend combining this list
with [searching through the elements using the inspector developer tool](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/dom/) to target
the components which you want to customize.

If there is a part of the Vizzly dashboard that you'd like to make customizable, please contact us through your 
shared slack channel with us, and we'll see what we can do to help.
