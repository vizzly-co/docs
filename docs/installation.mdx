# Installation

To add Vizzly to your React app, you'll need to install our node package, which can be added by running the following command:


<Tabs>
<TabItem value="yarn" label="Yarn">

```shell
yarn add @vizzly/components@0.0.162
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="npm" label="NPM">

```shell
npm install @vizzly/components@0.0.162
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Supported backends
Vizzly can be ran in multiple different ways. To see all the options and for guides on how to install Vizzly in each way, [see the deployment options](/category/deployment-options).


### Only react?
Currently, we do only provide a React library. We do want to offer support for other JavaScript libraries in the near future. If this is a requirement for you, please get in touch.
