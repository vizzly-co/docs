### Supported backends
Vizzly can be ran in multiple different ways. To see all the options and for guides on how to install Vizzly in each way, [see the deployment options](/category/deployment-options).


### Only react?
Currently, we do only provide a React library. We do want to offer support for other JavaScript libraries in the near future. If this is a requirement for you, please get in touch.
